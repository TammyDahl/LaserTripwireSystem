# Laser-Based Bed Exit Detection System | CS 578 Project
_Solo Project | SDSU CS 578 ‚Äì Wireless Networks_

## Overview
This individual project was inspired by [Raspberry Pi‚Äôs Laser Tripwire tutorial](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/laser-tripwire) and adapted to address a real-world healthcare use case. I designed and built a laser-based bed exit detection system using a Raspberry Pi, laser module, and photoresistor. I implemented the Python script to monitor beam interruptions and connected the system to IFTTT to trigger real-time alerts when a patient leaves bed. The project is intended for non-invasive patient monitoring in environments where individuals may not be able to ask for help. It demonstrates my ability to independently design, implement, and document an embedded system with real-time event detection‚Äîan experience that supports future work in IoT, automation, and real-world data capture.

## Problem Statement
Patients in psychiatric care, elder care, or pediatric settings may be unable to call for help or trigger a manual alert if they leave their bed. Missed bed exits can lead to injuries or slow response times. This system offers a non-invasive and automated solution to bridge that gap‚Äîno wearables or complex monitoring infrastructure required.

## How It Works
- A laser is mounted across the bed at exit level.
- A photoresistor (LDR) on the opposite side detects whether the beam is intact.
- A Python script on a Raspberry Pi monitors the signal.
- If the beam is interrupted, an IFTTT webhook sends an alert to a phone or email in real time.

## Key Technologies
- Raspberry Pi (GPIO, Python scripting)
- Laser and photoresistor circuit
- IFTTT Webhooks for remote alerts
- Future Considerations: logging beam interruptions, adding camera-based monitoring, or dashboard integrations

## Why I Included This in My Portfolio
While my primary interest lies in data analytics, AI, and applied data science, I believe this project shows:

- A strong understanding of system design and automation
- Comfort with scripting and hardware integration
- A practical approach to real-world problems
- The ability to own and deliver a complete solution from idea to demo

If you're hiring for a role that values technical problem-solving, real-world impact, and adaptability across tools and environments‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to connect.
